Data is everywhere around us. It is in our smartwatches, GPS trackers, posts on Instagram, or reviews on Google. The amount of it is huge and it is getting bigger every day.

Early on, as a beginner in the DA, I was thinking that Data is the main thing in analysis. I was wrong. It seemed right to me, to take the data and then search for the insights. But if you donâ€™t have a crisp goal, even with the credible and complete data your findings may be irrelevant.
The most important thing is to ask the right questions at the beginning of the project. We need to see clearly who is our target audience and what they want to know. What problem they want to solve or which new possibilities they want to find, for what purpose.

Only knowing our goal, we can discuss what data we will need and how we can get it. And do not forget about security: the question of who can have access to this data is maybe last, but not least.
