My name is Maryna, and I'm going to write here about tips and insights that I have recently learned. After almost 7 years of being a financial manager, I spent a few years with my family moving from country to country and getting used to my new role of mother. Then it hits me: why not expand into the world of data analysis? I've done some data analysis working with finance, so why not grasp new tools and make some really interesting things.

​​ Analysis of the data may confirm or disprove our hypothesis. Or even more interesting, it can open our eyes to completely new and unexpected aspects, problems, and, most importantly, opportunities. So I say to myself, go for it!
